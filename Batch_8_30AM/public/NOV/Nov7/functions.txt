Scope of a variable:

	The scope of a variable specifies the acccessability level of a variable. The scope  can be either local or global

Local/Private Data:  Data been declared in any module , becomes private data and it cannot be accessable outside of particular module.

Global/Public Data: Data which is declared outside of modules becomes public/global data, which can be accessable anywhere with in the same application.
