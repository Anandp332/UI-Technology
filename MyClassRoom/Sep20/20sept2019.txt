Difference between == and === operators:--> both are comparison operators used to compare value of left side variable with right side variables, when the only difference is while comparing values == operator only check for equality of values where as === operator checks for value equality along with valuetype equality.
example 
		var a =10;
		var b=30;
		a==b-> returns false
		var a=30;
		var b=30;
		a==b  -> returns true 

		var a=10;
		var b="10";
		a==b  -> returns true
		--------------------

		var a=10;
		var b=30;
		a===b  -> returns false

		var a=10;
		var b="10";
		a===b  -> returns false
looping control structure : following are set of looping control structure being supported in javascript using which we could able to execute the set of instruction more than one without rewriting instruction .

for loop:

		while 
		do while
		for each
		for in 
		for off.

example:
		

		q1> write a program to display values from 1 to 100.
		q2> write a program to display the value from 99 to 48.
		q3> write a program to display all the even number between 1 to 100.
		q4> write a program to find sum of all odd numbers between 90 to 35.
		q5> write a program to find sum of all even numbers from 1000 to 99.
		q6> write a program to display table of 5 till 20.
		5*1=5
		5*2=10
		5*3=15 like this .
		q7> write a program to take a number and check wether it is prime number or not.
