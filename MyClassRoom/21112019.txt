Socket Communication Through Node.js

socket.io is a library that enables real time bidirectional and event based Communication
browser and server. socket.io  provides a predefined node module to handle server side interactions,  
 it even provides, socket.io.js client side library file. Using which we can handle socket communications
 at client side. Through sockets it is not a direct communication instead the communication happens through
 a sub communication (pub & sub - publishing, subscribing). 

 Steps to implement socket at node server:
 1. download and include socket.io module
2. using io.on method configure a call back method which get invoked automatically
   when there is a connection to the server.
3. Using the socket object.
either broadcast or subscring with unique key.
