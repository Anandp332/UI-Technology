<!Project 1 — Media Queries
The goal for this project is to understand more about CSS media queries, and how they can help
 us ensure that the screen the user is using to view our website 
is presenting the websites we create in the best way possible.
In this project, you’ll make a website that contains media queries. The website that 
you create will notify the user in an obvious manner that certain media query
 breakpoints have been reached when the browser window is resized.
For example: In my version of this website, when the browser window is resized,
 I’ve chosen to use the background-color as an indicator to the user that a certain
  breakpoint has been reached. I’ve also made changes to the website’s
 text as certain breakpoints are reached letting them know how wide their web browser 
 window is currently, as they resize it.
Notify your user in any way that you see fit — just make it blatantly obvious 
that changes are being made when certain breakpoints are reached.
Your website must be responsive, and your HTML must be semantic. Any other 
styling or any other content changes are completely up to you.>
