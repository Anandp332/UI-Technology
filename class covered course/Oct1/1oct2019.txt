'setTimeout' and 'setInterval' Methods:
function parseInt(p){
	.....
	...
	return result;
}

the true predefine methods been supported in js using which we could able to execute the set of instructions not just when the controller reaches to it but to execute set of instructions only after the provided delay time .
syntax:
		setTimeout(<callbackfuntion> , <delaytime>);
		setInterval(<callbackfuntion> , <delaytime>);
'setTimeout' and 'setInterval' are almost like the same use to execute provided callback function after and interval of time where the only diff is settimeout will invoke the callback method only once after the provided delay time where as setInterval Method will keep repeatively in executing provided callback method with a gap of provided delay time .
Note: 'clearInterval()': 
		'clearInterval()' is a predefine method using which we could stop a second interval method execution
