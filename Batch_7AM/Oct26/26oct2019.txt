'ready' Method - Takes a callback function as a input and invokes the function only after the complete dom structure gets loaded.

$(document).ready(function(){
    ...
    ...// set of instruction which gets executed only after the complete Dom structure gets loaded.
});

'load' Method  - Its almost like and ready method , where the only difference is, load method not just waits for the Dom structure 
to gets loaded , but it even waits for complete resources on the page to loaded(image with huge size, heavy size js or css external files etc.)
