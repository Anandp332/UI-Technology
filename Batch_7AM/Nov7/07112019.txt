    | Nodejs - Server site 
    | ( chrome Using V8 Engine ) - That why chrome is faster than other web browser. 
    |  Nodejs - is cross platform (independent platform)

            Nodejs a populor Server was written initially by Mr. Ryan Dal in 2009.
            It has the height and advantages to create a Server which uses javascript as programming language .

            Nodejs is a very first Server uses javascript as programming language at Server end.
            its an opensource , crossplatform javascript runtime in the invironment developed on chrome V8 js Engine which is directly
            into the native machine code.

            Its a lightweight framework used to developed Server site web application .
            It uses event driven non blocking input/output model which makes it the right choice for data intensive realtime application.

Features:-->


        Follwing are the height and Features been supported in Nodejs which are making it so populor and powerful.
            1>Opensource:-> Its an Opensource platform which means the copyright holder has given various rights of studying & distributing 
                            the software  to any place for any purpose (Commercial & Non-Commercial).

                                It is highly Scalable & helps the Server in non-blocking response.
                    
            3>Simple & Fast :-> As Nodejs is builds on google chrome V8 Engine ,

            5>Single threded:-> As it uses process of events looping, it is able follow single threded module.

            6> Cross Platform:-> Nodejs can be easily created and deployed into chrome platform like windows , mac , linux etc.
